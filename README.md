Don't bother reading this README.md, reading is for chumps!

But the only commands you should need in this repository are:

    bash generate-dataset.sh <filename> <number of records>
  
and if you want to replicate the results I got add time in front of it:

    time bash generate-dataset.sh <filename> <number of records>
  
to sort with the script just run:

    bash sort-data.sh <filename>
